# visa-wait-times

Just a simple way to check the visa wait times from travel.state.gov. Don't use it to spam them! Maybe go through `cities.js` if using js or `cities.py` if using python and comment out a few cities you don't care about. Written in Python and JavaScript.

# Using JS
`cd js`
`npm run start` 

# Using Python
`cd python`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python main.py`
Running the script will write a CSV file called `results.csv`
